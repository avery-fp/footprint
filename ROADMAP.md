# FOOTPRINT — ROAD TO 10/10

## 🔴 LAUNCH BLOCKERS (do before first share)
- [ ] Kill remaining ghost tiles (empty content cards in void + any other room)
- [ ] Mobile check — verify rooms/landing/checkout work on iPhone
- [ ] "OWN YOUR FOOTPRINT" CTA visibility — make it harder to miss
- [ ] Verify full Stripe flow end-to-end (test purchase → serial assignment → edit access)
- [ ] Meta tags / OG image — when someone shares footprint.onl on Twitter/iMessage, what shows?

## 🟡 V1.1 — NATIVE TILE RENDERING (post-launch, high priority)
- [ ] YouTube URLs → extract thumbnail as still tile, click plays video inline (custom translucent play icon, ae aesthetic, no YT chrome)
- [ ] Spotify URLs → extract album art as tile, click plays 30s preview or opens Spotify
- [ ] Instagram URLs → extract image as native tile, click opens IG post
- [ ] Twitter/X URLs → render tweet content as styled tile (text + author), click opens tweet
- [ ] SoundCloud URLs → extract waveform art as tile, click plays inline
- [ ] Generic links → extract OG image as tile with subtle link indicator

## 🟢 V1.2 — POLISH
- [ ] PWA manifest (add to home screen = fullscreen app experience)
- [ ] Tile click-through to source URL for image tiles
- [ ] Room wallpaper per-room (different wallpaper for each room, not just global)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop tile reordering in edit mode
- [ ] Tile size options (1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2 in the masonry grid)

## 🔵 DISTRIBUTION (immediate — the actual revenue driver)
- [ ] OG meta image that screenshots well
- [ ] Share link strategy — what URL do people share? /ae or footprint.onl?
- [ ] First 10 users — who gets a free footprint to seed the network?
- [ ] Content strategy — where does ae post about this?
- [ ] Referral loop — does a footprint owner get anything for sharing?
